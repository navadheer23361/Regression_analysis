# Regression_analysis

Objective: This task demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using the Housing dataset. The primary goal is to understand how different features (like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) influence house prices and build a predictive model using regression techniques.

We will work with: Data Import and Preprocessing, Handle categorical features using Label Encoding, Checking for missing values, Select relevant features for modeling, Visualize the regression line and interpret results, Multiple Linear Regression by using multiple features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking), Evaluating the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ², Visualizing predictions vs actual values and
Interpret model coefficients

Outcome: The final model provides insights into how different features affect housing prices and helps in accurately predicting prices using linear models. The project reinforces understanding of regression, feature impact, and model evaluation techniques.
